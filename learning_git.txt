********************************************************** TERMINOLOGY*********************************************************************

`git --version` is used to check the current version of Git installed on your PC.

// REPOSITORY:

A repository is a collection of files and directories that are stored together. It is a way to store and manage your code. A repository is like a folder on your computer, but it is more than just a folder. It can contain other files, folders, and even other repositories. You can think of a repository as a container that holds all your code.

`git status` -> to track the repository status

// `pwd` -> to check the current location
// `git config --global user.email "shatrughanshukla00@gmail.com"`
// `git config --global user.name "shatrughanshukla"`

The `git status` command is used to display the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This command is very useful for understanding what is going on in your repository at any given time.

Here is a breakdown of what `git status` provides:

- Untracked files: Files in your working directory that are not being tracked by Git.
- Changes not staged for commit: Files that have been modified but not yet added to the staging area.
- Changes to be committed: Files that have been added to the staging area and will be included in the next commit.

It is recommended to run `git status` before creating a commit to ensure that you understand the current state of your working directory. This helps you to:

- Verify that there are no uncommitted changes that you might want to include in the commit.99995
- Ensure that you are in the correct directory and not accidentally creating a repository in the wrong location.
- Identify any untracked files that you might want to add to the repository.

// `git init`

The `git init` command is used to create a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing project into a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. When you run `git init`, it creates a new `.git` subdirectory in your project directory, which contains all the necessary metadata for the repository.

Here is how you can use `git init`:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
    ```
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```

2. Initialize a new Git repository:
    ```
    git init
    ```

After running `git init`, your project directory will be set up as a Git repository, and you can start tracking changes, creating commits, and using other Git commands.

There are hidden files under the repository, and to access them, we run `ls -la`, which shows all the files under the repository, hidden and unhidden. Then simply write `cd filename` to enter into it, like we did here with `.git`, and then we can see all the directories and files under this by running `ls -la`.

// `ls -la`

The `ls -la` command is used to list all files and directories in the current directory, including hidden files. The `-l` option provides a detailed list with file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and timestamp. The `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot).

Here is how you can use `ls -la`:

1. Navigate to your desired directory:
    ```
    cd /path/to/your/directory
    ```

2. List all files and directories, including hidden ones:
    ```
    ls -la
    ```

This command is useful for inspecting the contents of a directory, especially when you need to see hidden files like `.git` in a Git repository.


// // git add <file> <file2> to add files to staging area.
// // git add . it will stage all files present in the repository.

// // git rm --cached <filename> this will unstage the file.

// // git reset <file> Removes changes from the staging area without deleting them from the working directory.

// // Use git diff --staged to see the changes staged for commit.

// // git commit -m "Commit Message" Here we are committing the changes to the repository. We can see that the changes are now committed to the repository. The -m flag is used to add a message to the commit. This message is a short description of the changes that were made. You can use this message to remember what the changes were. Missing the -m flag will result in an action that opens your default settings editor, which is usually VIM. But we've changed it to vscode.

// // git log This command will show you the history of your repository. It will show you all the commits that were made to the repository. 
// // git log --one line  We can use the --oneline flag to show only the commit message. This will make the output more compact and easier to read.

// Atomic commits are a way to make sure that each commit is a self-contained unit of work. This means that if one commit fails, you can always go back to a previous commit and fix the issue.
This is important for maintaining a clean and organized history in your repository.
When you're working in the working diresctory then it is a good practice to commit the task atomically means when 1 feature or task is competed commit it, it helps us to make clean commit history so we can easily track back our work.


// // git config --global core.editor "code --wait" we already have changed our default code editor.

// //.gitignore - it is a file in which when we write a file name then git will ignore that file and will not ask to commit or add it.
It is used when we don't want to commit or add sensitive files to staging area or repository, e.g. .env file .


// A .env file is commonly used in software development to store environment variables.
These variables are key-value pairs that configure application settings without hardcoding them into the source code.
The .env file is a simple and effective way to manage application configurations and sensitive data securely.
By using it appropriately, developers can ensure better scalability, maintainability, and security for their applications. // 

// .gitkeep is used when you want to add empty folder in the staging area or repository, by default git don't ask empty folder to add into repositories or staging area and if we want to store it then we have to use .git keep like we did here with image folder.
we can see git is asking image folder to add and commit but not to log. //


// * git commit -a -m "Message"    # Automatically stages modified and deleted files before committing but we should try to avoid this as we should use git add and git commit to take granular control over the files.


********************************************************** Git Behind The Scenes*********************************************************************

// // cd ../../CODEEE use this code for going to desired file.

// // TO remove a repository from git the steps are 
1.) cd path/to/parent/directory  navigate to the repository's parent directory.
2.) rm -rf .git This removes the .git directory, which contains all the metadata for the Git repository.
3.) git status


prefer notes from chai and code.

<<<<<<< HEAD
********************************************************** Git Branches and conflicts ***************************************************************

// // git branch -d branch_name 
The -d option (short for --delete) safely deletes the branch.
Git will prevent deletion if the branch has unmerged changes to avoid losing work.

// // git branch -D branch_name
Force Delete

// // git merge --abort easiest way is to abort the merging when you're not able to merge.

Learning and checking for conflicts


HEAD in Git :
The HEAD is a pointer to the current branch that you are working on. It points to the latest commit in the current branch.
When you create a new branch, it is automatically set as the HEAD of that branch.
// // some important commands :
git branch
git branch bug-fix
git switch bug-fix
git log
git switch master
git switch -c dark-mode
git checkout orange-mode // //

///
git branch - This command lists all the branches in the current repository.
git branch bug-fix - This command creates a new branch called bug-fix.
git switch bug-fix - This command switches to the bug-fix branch.
git log - This command shows the commit history for the current branch.
git switch master - This command switches to the master branch.
git switch -c dark-mode - This command creates a new branch called dark-mode. the -c flag is used to create a new branch.
git checkout orange-mode - This command switches to the orange-mode branch.
Commit before switching to a branch
Go to .git folder and checkout to the HEAD file
///

MERGING BRANCHES :


This one is easy as branch that you are trying to merge is usually ahead and there are no conflicts.

When you are done working on a branch, you can merge it back into the main branch. This is done using the following command:
// // git checkout main
// // git merge bug-fix
// This is a fast-forward merge. It means that the commits in the bug-fix branch are directly merged into the main branch. This can be useful when you want to merge a branch that has already been pushed to the remote repository.

// // // Not fast-forwarded merge :
In this type of merge, the master branch also worked and have some commits that are not in the bug-fix branch. This is a not fast-forward merge.

If the command are same, what is the difference between fast-forward and not fast-forward merge?

The difference is resolving the conflicts. In a fast-forward merge, there are no conflicts. But in a not fast-forward merge, there are conflicts, and there are no shortcuts to resolve them.
You have to manually resolve the conflicts. Decide, what to keep and what to discard.
VSCode has a built-in merge tool that can help you resolve the conflicts.

// // git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name> rename a branch.

******************************************************** Git diff, stash and tag ******************************************************************************************


// // // git diff


// // git diff This command shows the unstaged changes in your working directory compared to the staging area. This command alone will not show you the changes made in the file A and file B, you need to provide options to show the changes.
// // git diff --staged This command shows the changes between your last commit and the staging area (i.e., changes that are staged and ready to be committed).
// // git diff <branch-name-one> <branch-name-two> This command compares the difference between two branches.
another way to compare 
// // git diff <branch-name-one>..<branch-name-two>

git diff <commit-hash-one> <commit-hash-two> This command compares the difference between two commits.


// // // git stash 


Stash is a way to save your changes in a temporary location. It is useful when you want to make changes to a file but don’t want to commit them yet. You can then come back to the file later and apply the changes.

// // git stash This command saves your changes in a temporary location. It is like a stack of changes that you can access later.

// // git stash save "work in progresson x feature" Naming the stash

// // git stash list the list of stashes

// // git stash apply apply the stash

// // git stash apply stash@{0} apply the specific stash

// // git stash pop You can apply and drop the stash by using the following command

// // git stash drop you can drop the stash by using thsi command

// // git stash clear You can clear the stash by using the following command

// // git stash apply@{0} <branch name>

git tag -a	Creates an annotated tag.
git commit -a	Stages and commits all modified and deleted files (except untracked ones).


// // // tag 

// // git tag -a <tag-name> -m "Message to be passed"
This command creates an annotated tag with the specified name and message. The tag will be attached to the current commit.

Annotated tags are a type of tag in Git that are stored as full Git objects in the repository.
They include additional metadata such as:
- Tagger Information
- Message
- optional cpg signature

// // git tag List all tags

// // git tag <tag-name> <commit-hash> , Tagging a specific commit

// // git push origin <tag-name> , push tag to remote repository

// // git tag -d <tag-name> delete a tag

// // git push origin :<tag-name>

**********************************************************Rebase and Reflog**********************************************************************************
greenMode created.

// // // Rebase in Git 

Ensure you are on the branch you want to rebase:
// // git checkout feature branch
// // git rebase main
This will replay the commits from feature-branch on top of the latest changes in main.


If there are any conflicts, you will need to resolve them manually. You can use the merge tool in VSCode to resolve the conflicts.
// // git add <resolved-files>
// // git rebase --continue
Try to avoid —force option when using rebase. It can cause issues with the project history.

// // // Reflag in git 

Git reflog is a command that shows you the history of your commits.
It allows you to see the changes that you have made to your repository over time.
This can be useful for debugging and understanding the history of your project.

// // git reflog , view the reflog.
// // git reflog <commit-hash> find specific commit.


Recover lost commits or changes
If you accidentally deleted a branch or made changes that are no longer visible in the commit history, you can often recover them using the reflog.
First, find the reference to the commit where the branch or changes existed, and then reset your branch to that reference.

// // git reflog <commit-hash>
// // git reset --hard <commit-hash>

or you can use HEAD@{n} to reset to the nth commit before the one you want to reset to.

// // git reflog <commit-hash>
// // git reset --hard HEAD@{1}

************************************************************** Learning GitHub **********************************************************************************************
git branch -M main , The command git branch -M main is used to rename the current branch to main in Git.


// // // // Doubts // // // //

I pushed a branch using git push origin main then I added more lines in working directory of a pushed file then I used git add . and then commited and used git pushed this gave an error fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
then i used the command git push origin main and it got pushed to the remote repository and  I got output Enumerating objects: 5, done.

 * [new branch]      main -> main , but when I checked in github then the code was their but with a conflict of 178th line and then I resolved that conflict and pulled then it was all okay.
why this happened with git push origin main and why it is advice to create an upstreame remote by using git push -u origin main , how it makes difference ?

// // solution

The error and the subsequent behavior you experienced are related to how Git handles branches and their **upstream tracking** in remote repositories. Here's an explanation of what happened and why it is recommended to set an upstream branch:

---

### **Why Did You Encounter the Error?**
When you ran:
```bash
git push origin main
```
- Git tried to push the `main` branch to the remote repository `origin`.
- Since the branch `main` did not have an **upstream branch** set, Git didn’t know which remote branch to track or push the changes to by default.
- Git prompted you with:
  > *fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.*
  - This means the local branch `main` wasn't linked to the remote branch `main`.

---

### **How `git push -u origin main` Helps**
When you use the command:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
- The `-u` (short for `--set-upstream`) flag sets the **upstream branch** for your local branch `main` to the remote branch `main` on `origin`.
- After this setup, you can simply use:
  ```bash
  git push
  ```
  instead of specifying `origin main` every time.

---

### **Key Benefits of Setting an Upstream Branch**
1. **Simplifies Workflow**:
   - After setting the upstream, Git knows which remote branch to push to or pull from. You no longer need to specify `origin main`.

2. **Streamlines Collaboration**:
   - Commands like `git pull` and `git push` will automatically work with the correct remote branch, reducing errors and friction when working with remote repositories.

3. **Syncs Local and Remote Branches**:
   - Git keeps track of which commits are on your local branch versus the remote branch. This helps prevent issues like forgetting to pull before pushing.

---

### **Why Did You Encounter the Conflict?**
- When you resolved the conflict, it indicated that the remote branch already had some changes that were not in your local branch.
- This happened because:
  1. The remote branch (`main`) was updated directly on GitHub or by another collaborator.
  2. You pushed your changes without pulling the latest changes from the remote first.

---

### **Best Practices to Avoid Conflicts**
1. **Set Upstream Immediately**:
   - Use `git push -u origin <branch>` the first time you push a new branch.

2. **Pull Before Pushing**:
   - Always run `git pull` or `git fetch` and check for updates from the remote before making a push.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

3. **Resolve Conflicts Locally**:
   - If there are conflicts, Git will pause the merge and let you resolve them locally. After resolving, commit the changes and push again.

---

### **Summary**
1. The error occurred because your local branch `main` didn’t have an upstream branch set.
2. Using `git push -u origin main` establishes an upstream branch, making it easier to work with remote repositories.
3. The conflict occurred because your local branch and the remote branch had diverging changes. Pulling and resolving conflicts is a necessary step when working in a collaborative environment.

---

### **Commands Cheat Sheet**
1. Push and set upstream:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. Pull changes before pushing:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
3. View upstream branch:
   ```bash
   git branch -vv
   ```
4. Change upstream branch (if needed):
   ```bash
   git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
   ```

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Adding code to remote repository
// // git init
// // git add <files>
// // git commit -m "commit message"

Check remote url setting
// // git remote -v , This will show you the remote url of your repository.

Add remote repository
// // git remote add origin <remote-url>


Push code to remote repository
// // git push origin main


Setup and upstreame remote

Setting up an upstream remote is useful when you want to keep your local repository up to date with the remote repository. It allows you to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into your local repository.

// // git remote add upstream <remote-url>
or shorthhand 
// // git remote add -u <remote-url>
 however this is unnecessary 

// // // git push -u origin main
This will set up an upstream remote and push your code to the remote repository.

This will allow you to run future commands like git pull and git push without specifying the remote name.

// // // // // /// // / // / / / / / / / / / / / /// / / / / / / / / / / / // / / / / / // / / // / doubt 
You **don’t need to run `git remote add -u <remote-url>`** before running `git push -u origin main`. The command:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

is enough to both push your branch and set the upstream tracking branch for it.

---

### **Explanation**

#### **What `git push -u origin main` Does**
- The `-u` (or `--set-upstream`) option:
  1. Pushes your local branch (`main`) to the remote (`origin`).
  2. Sets up a tracking connection between your local branch (`main`) and the remote branch (`origin/main`).
     - This means that future commands like `git push` and `git pull` will automatically know which remote branch to sync with, without requiring you to specify `origin main`.

---

#### **What `git remote add -u <remote-url>` Does**
- The `git remote add` command is typically used to add a **new remote** to your repository.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
    ```
  - This adds the remote named `origin` with the provided URL.

- If you're using `git remote add -u`, it will attempt to add a remote URL and set it as upstream. However, this is unnecessary if you've already pushed using `git push -u origin main`.

---

### **When You Only Need `git push -u origin main`**
If you've already added a remote (e.g., using `git remote add origin <url>`), you can skip any additional remote commands. Running:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

is sufficient to:
1. Push your branch to the remote.
2. Set the upstream tracking branch.

---

### **When You Might Use `git remote add`**
You only need to run `git remote add` if:
1. You’re starting with a repository that does not yet have a remote configured.
2. You want to add a new remote (e.g., if you want to push to a different Git hosting service).

Example workflow:
1. Add the remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <remote-url>
   ```
2. Push and set upstream:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### **Conclusion**
- **`git push -u origin main`** alone is sufficient if your remote is already configured.
- **`git remote add <name> <url>`** is only required if you need to add a new remote before pushing for the first time.

tell me about pull and fetch git commands how, where and when to you and how to  use with other commands ?

Git's `pull` and `fetch` commands are used to sync your local repository with changes from a remote repository, but they work differently and serve distinct purposes.

---

## **1. Git `fetch`**

### **What It Does:**
- Downloads new commits, files, and references from the remote repository **but does not apply them** to your working directory or the current branch.
- Updates the remote tracking branches (e.g., `origin/main`) but leaves your local branch untouched.

### **When to Use:**
- Use `fetch` when you want to see what changes have been made in the remote repository before deciding to incorporate them into your branch.
- It’s helpful to inspect changes before merging or rebasing.

### **How to Use:**
- Basic `fetch` command:
  ```bash
  git fetch
  ```
  This fetches changes for all branches from the remote repository.

- Fetch a specific branch:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin main
  ```
  Fetches updates for the `main` branch only.

### **Common Scenarios:**
1. **Inspect Before Merging**:
   ```bash
   git fetch
   git log origin/main
   ```
   This lets you review the fetched changes before incorporating them.
   
2. **Sync with a Remote Branch**:
   After fetching, you can merge the changes manually:
   ```bash
   git fetch
   git merge origin/main
   ```

---

## **2. Git `pull`**

### **What It Does:**
- Combines `fetch` and `merge` in a single step:
  1. Fetches changes from the remote repository.
  2. Automatically merges the fetched changes into your current branch.

### **When to Use:**
- Use `pull` when you are confident about immediately integrating remote changes into your branch.
- Ideal for quickly syncing your branch with the remote.

### **How to Use:**
- Pull the current branch from its tracked upstream branch:
  ```bash
  git pull
  ```
  This fetches and merges changes from the branch you are tracking (e.g., `origin/main`).

- Pull a specific branch:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

### **Common Scenarios:**
1. **Sync Before Working**:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
   Ensures your branch has the latest changes before starting work.
   
2. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   If there are merge conflicts during `pull`, Git will pause for you to resolve them manually.

## **Key Differences Between `fetch` and `pull`**

| **Feature**          | **`fetch`**                               | **`pull`**                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Operation**         | Downloads changes only.                  | Downloads and merges changes.           |
| **Working Directory** | Unaffected.                              | Updated if merge succeeds.              |
| **Use Case**          | Inspect or review changes first.         | Quickly sync with the remote.           |
| **Safety**            | Non-disruptive (no direct changes).       | May cause merge conflicts directly.     |

---

## **Using `fetch` and `pull` with Other Commands**

1. **Combining `fetch` with `merge`:**
   - Fetch changes and merge them manually:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin main
     git merge origin/main
     ```
   - This gives you more control, allowing you to review changes before merging.

2. **Combining `fetch` with `rebase`:**
   - Fetch changes and rebase your branch:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin main
     git rebase origin/main
     ```
   - Rebasing applies your changes on top of the remote branch, creating a cleaner commit history.

3. **Resolving Conflicts After `pull`:**
   - If you encounter conflicts after pulling:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     # Resolve conflicts in files.
     git add <conflicted-files>
     git commit
     ```

---

## **When to Choose Which Command**

| **Scenario**                                   | **Command to Use**      | **Why**                                         |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| You want to inspect remote changes before applying them. | `git fetch`              | Prevents unintended changes to your branch.   |
| You want to quickly sync your branch with the remote.   | `git pull`               | Combines fetch and merge for faster syncing.  |
| You want fine-grained control over merging or rebasing. | `git fetch` + `merge`    | Enables review and manual control.           |
| You want to rewrite your commit history cleanly.       | `git fetch` + `rebase`   | Keeps a linear commit history.               |
